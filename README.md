⚠️ The versions with Wi-Fi & Bluetooth are more common, but it generally is the same thing just with few patches for those chips to work. As that motherboard is much more popular than what I have without, you can browse through other repositories here and see what and how they patched the hardware to work, but I reckon is pretty easy because I've seen those confirmed to work just fine.

###  💿 ​Installation Notes
* [Check Dortania's guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) for the detailed guide on all parts
* Generate correct serial numbers and replace the "XXXX" placeholders in the config.plist
* If you are using supported AMD card, you should have full hardware acelleration by default with this configuration
* If you use another processor with iGPU, there might be some tweaks you will need to do by yourself
